The wheelchairâ€™s design has changed throughout the years in order to increase
performance and make it safer. However, accidents do occur frequently for
wheelchair users due to falls or accidental contact with the surroundings. This
highlights the need for more safety on the wheelchair to reduce accidents. This
research work hence investigates utilizing sensor array technology to improve
current wheelchair driving safety. Ultrasonic sensors are employed together with an
obstacle avoidance feature to aid wheelchair users in navigating their surroundings
easily. 

Firstly, the choice of different types of sensors is discussed and considered.
Secondly, different obstacle avoidance algorithm is explored. A new obstacle
avoidance strategy inspired by previous obstacle avoidance algorithm such as the
artificial potential field and vector field histogram is then derived. Meanwhile,
certain existing wheelchair designs have been analysed. Next, the design process,
setup of the wheelchair and the various experiments are discussed in detail too.
Finally, the effectiveness of both the sensor placement and obstacle avoidance
strategy is then evaluated in different situations by testing the wheelchair in corridors
and an obstacle route.
