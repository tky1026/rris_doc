**Documentation**

For new FYP documentation, please start from the templates below:

.. include:: /Doc/_Templates/fyp.rst.txt
   :code: rst

* Name the documentation ``.rst`` file with format ``fyp_firstname.rst``. The file should store within folder ``FYP``.

* If the student uploads the final report to `DR-NTU <https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/>`__, 
  go to the item record to get the **identifier link** for ``DR-NTU``. Otherwise put a ``NA``.

  .. image:: /Doc/Resources/_Asset/drntu-identifier.png
     :alt: DR-NTU identifier link

* We should always keep a copy of students' FYP final report, stored at <link-to-final-report-repo>. 
  Provide link to correspoding final report for ``Final report``.

* After students' work uploaded to GitHub as mentioned above, provide link to corresponding GitHub repository for ``GitHub``. 

* Always remember to update the date for ``Latest update`` after every edit.
