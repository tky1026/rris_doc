reStructuredText & Sphinx
=========================

This chapter is an introduction and reference for writing documentation using reStructuredText (also referred to as reST) and Sphinx.

It is recommended to read (or at least browse through) the :ref:`Introduction <code-rst-intro>` and the general :ref:`Coding guidelines for reST files <doc-cgl-rest>` first. 
For more details, look up at specific topics on :ref:`code-rst-ref`.

Also read :ref:`common pitfalls <code-rst-pitfall>` in order to avoid common mistakes with the syntax and make sure to :ref:`setup your editor or IDE <howto-tools-doc>` correctly to detect and show errors in the syntax.

You don’t need to read the entire chapter, just lookup the section that is relevant for what you plan to do. Or, use the :ref:`reST & Sphinx cheat sheet <code-rst-cheatsheet>`, which contains the most commonly used markup on one page.

We won’t be covering every reST markup that is available. For more information, see other resources, such as: `Quick reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_.
