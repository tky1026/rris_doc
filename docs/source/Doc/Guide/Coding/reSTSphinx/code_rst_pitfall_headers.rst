Problems With Headers
=====================

If you use section titles (headers), the underline must be **at least** as long as the text.

Though you can make the underlines longer than the text, common practice throughout the docs is to to keep it the same length.

Correct syntax
==============

.. code-block:: rst

   ================
   This Is a Header
   ================

   Another Header
   ==============

   This Is Also Correct but Not Recommended
   ======================================================

Wrong syntax
============

.. code-block:: rst

   Another header
   ------------
