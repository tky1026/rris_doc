reST & Sphinx Cheat Sheet
=========================

The documentations are written in :term:`reStructuredText` and built by :term:`Sphinx`. 
Here is a quick and dirty cheat sheet for some common reST stuff used in this documentation. 
You can see the literal source code of the reST file on the right, and the rendered output on the left.

.. note:: 
   For a more complete description of reST syntax, please refer to :ref:`code-rst-ref` or :ref:`external sources <code-rst-ref-extref>`.
