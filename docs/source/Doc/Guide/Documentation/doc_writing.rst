Documentation Style
===================

By using this style guide we ensure that all written texts have the same general grammar and writing style — even when many people contribute.

Style guides can become very, very long. We keep this guide short to make sure you read it, but it means we only cover the most important topics. 
If you would like to read more about style and usage, check out `Google Developer Documentation Style Guide <https://developers.google.com/style/>`_.

Writing style
=============

Spelling
--------

We write using British (UK) spelling, as Singapore uses the British English in the spelling system. That means, we write *colour*, rather than *color*, 
and use *-yse* endings, rather than *-yze* english, i.e. *paralyse* vs *paralyze*.

.. _doc-sgl-title-case:

Title case
----------

We capitalize all principal words of a title, including the first and the last words. We do not capitalize articles, prepositions or conjunctions that have fewer than four letters, such as: 

* a
* an
* and
* at
* but
* by
* for
* in
* nor
* of
* on
* or
* so
* the
* to
* up
* yet

For reference, check the "AP" capitalization at `capitalizemytitle.com <capitalizemytitle.com>`_.

**Examples:**

    Rehabilitation Research Institute of Singapore

.. _doc-sgl-sentence-case:

Sentence case
-------------

Sentence case is a capitalization style in which only the first word of a sentence and proper nouns are capitalized, with the rest of the words in lowercase.

We use sentence case in this documentation for all headings and subheadings.

**Examples:**

    There is rain in the forecast this week in New York City.

Numbers
-------

Numbers are written using a dot “.” as decimal separator, while comma “,” as thousands separator is optional. We normally use max two decimals. The number of decimals used should reflect the text's need for accuracy.

A zero should be included before the dot in numbers less than 1.0.

Very large integer numbers (those above 999,999), if not representing actual raw data values, should be written using million, billion, or trillion, replacing the last six or nine digits.

Numbers less than ten are spelt out, unless they are dates or part of a list with larger values.

**Examples:**

    The difference is less than 0.5.

    The experiment has 12,481 participants.

    The function nesting limit is set to 1000.

    That is exactly 99.96% true.

    The file has more than 30 million lines.

    We need at least five developers.

Currency
--------

Currency values are written using the three-letter ISO code, followed by a space, followed by the value written according to our number style. 

Currency symbols, such as € and $ can be used as a shortened form. They are placed in front of the value, with no space separating them

**Examples:**

    The PC cost $3500.

    We made a profit of exactly SGD 25,060.17.

Dates
-----

We prefer the internation date style: **day, month, year**. 
Days are written in digits and years are always written in four digits.
We always write the month name as dates wirtten as numbers only will always cause confusion.
For example 1/11/2011, people might understand it as 1-Nov or 11-Jan.

Month names are normally written in full, but can be abbreviated if needed: 
Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.

**Examples:**

    25 December 2018

    12 Sep 2019

Comma in Lists
--------------

The Oxford comma (also known as the ‘serial comma’ in the US) is a comma placed before the last item in a list of three or more things. Sometimes, this can help ensure clarity.

Typically, in British English, we only use an Oxford comma when a list would be unclear without one, such as in the example sentence below:

    I’m going out with my brothers, Tim and Dave.

This sentence is ambiguous. Is it a list of three items? Or are my brothers named Tim and Dave? We can clarify this instantly by adding an Oxford comma before ‘Dave’, as shown below:

    I’m going out with my brothers, Tim, and Dave.

Quotes
------

Exact quotes are written between double quotation marks. Quotes within quotes are written between single quotes. 
For long quoted sections, we use indented block quotations without quotation marks. 
Periods and commas are placed within quotation marks. Colons and semicolons are placed outside of quotation marks.

**Examples:**

    I felt great each time he said “I love Singapore.”

    “I love Singapore,” he said enthusiastically.

    The poem goes:

        Roses are red

        Violets are blue

Emphasis
--------

We use *italics* for emphasis on single words or compound words. **Bold** text is used to increase visibility on words, compound words, parts of sentences, and sentences. We *never* use underlined text.

**Examples:**

    This text is *not* underlined for emphasis.

    This year’s **accounts are looking very good**.
